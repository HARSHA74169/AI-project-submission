# Employee Sentiment Analysis Project

--Overview
This project analyzes an unlabeled dataset of employee messages to assess sentiment and engagement.  
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and statistical analysis, the project identifies sentiment trends, ranks employees, flags flight risks, and builds a predictive model to forecast future sentiment scores.

--Deliverables
- **Final Report: Detailed methodology, EDA findings, scoring/ranking, flight risk, predictive model, results, and conclusion.
- Visualizations Folder**: Charts and graphs summarizing EDA, employee rankings, flight risk analysis, and model performance.
- README.md: Concise summary of findings and recommendations.
- Codebase: Python scripts and notebooks for analysis.

-- Key Results
- Top 3 Positive Employees 
- Top 3 Negative Employees
- Flight Risk Employees

-- Insights
- Neutral sentiment dominates overall, but negative spikes align with deadlines/events.
- Longer emails often correlate with stronger sentiment (positive or negative).
- A small group of employees drive most communication volume.
- Predictive model shows message frequency and proportion of negativity as strongest drivers.

--Recommendations
- Monitor flagged employees monthly.
- Recognize and reward consistently positive communicators.
- Use predictive insights to plan HR interventions during high-stress periods.
